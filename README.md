######INSTRUCTIONS : The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open app.js and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
